title: "Hello, World!"
topic: "Basic Navigation"

scenario: >
  You've just logged into your first Linux terminal as a junior engineer.
  The screen is blank, the cursor is blinking — it's time to speak!
  Try saying something simple like: Hello, world.
  (Hint: There's a command that lets you "echo" your thoughts into the terminal.)

description: >
  Your mission is to print "Hello, world!" to the terminal using
  the right command and syntax.

objective: "Learn to output text using the echo command."
expected_command: "echo 'Hello, world!'"
validation_type: "output_match"

input_feedback:
  - match: "echo Hello, world!"
    response: > 
      Almost! You're missing quotes, which help treat the sentence
      as a single argument.

  - match: "print"
    response: > 
      'print' is common in programming languages like Python, but 
       not here. Try a shell command.

  - match: "ecoh"
    response: "Did you mean `echo`?"

hints:
  - level: 1
    text: "The command you're looking for starts with an 'e' and ends in 'cho'."
  - level: 2
    text: "Are you missing any quotes ('')?"
  - level: 3
    text: "Use the 'echo' command with your message in quotes: echo 'Hello, world!'"

reflection:
  - question: "What did the 'echo' command do?"
    input_required: true
  - question: "Why do you think the quotes were necessary?"
    input_required: false

success_message: > 
  Great job! You just echoed your first message. 
  Let’s keep going — the terminal awaits.
